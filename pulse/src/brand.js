/**
 * Brand configuration for the app.
 *
 * `pulse` is the DEFAULT and must stay the standard look for the book and the
 * deployed site (gorvis.github.io/book-pm-management/pulse/). `yorku` is an
 * opt-in classroom variant selected at build time with Vite mode `yorku`:
 *
 *   npm run dev:yorku      npm run build:yorku
 *
 * which loads `.env.yorku` (VITE_BRAND=yorku). A plain `npm run dev` / `build`
 * has no VITE_BRAND set and therefore renders Pulse, unchanged.
 *
 * Only branding differs between the two — colors and the product name. There
 * are no feature or data differences. The localStorage key is intentionally
 * shared (see useEntries.js) and is NOT branded.
